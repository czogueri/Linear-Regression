# Linear-Regression

#This repository is dedicated to using linear regresson machine learning model on my research data from my studies-(wavelength VS absorbtion) in order to predict the most optimum wavelength with respect to the absorption Intensity. 

#Also includes my practice with arbitrary data

#All data files are also uploaded.
